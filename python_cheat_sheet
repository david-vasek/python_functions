Python Cheat Sheet

Types

Strings - any kind of characters in quotes
"This is 1 single string, it's in quotes."
Integer - numbers, no quotes
1
Boolean
True or False
Lists - collection of items, in [] brackets
["String", 1, 2, "Another string"]
Dictionary - collection of items using key:value pairs
{
    "name": "Bruce Wayne",
    "profession": "Batman"
}
Loops

A for loop will loop over each item in a collection of items.

list_of_numbers = [1,2,3]

for number in list_of_numbers:
    # For this example, we'll print each number
    print(number)
A while loop will loop over items until a condition is no longer True

my_string = "Green Lantern Corp"
index = 0

while index < len(my_string):
    # For this example, we'll print each character in the string based on the value of the index
    print(my_string[index])
Functions

A function will have four key parts:

The function keyword
A unique name (make it descriptive!)
Parentheses, (), follow the name and can accept parameters (if needed!)
The function body, which will return a value
REMINDER: If no value is explicitly returned, Python will return None
# name is a parameter, we'll pass the value as an argument when we call the function
def greeting(name):
    return "Hello %s!" % (name)

# The variable `sean` will be assigned the value returned from the `greeting()` function
# We pass the string "Sean" as an argument into the function `greeting()`
sean = greeting("Sean")

print(sean)
